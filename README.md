# web-scraping-stock-data

This project utilized web scraping to effectively build an intereactive stock website for users. Our site is mainly geared towards users that are looking to know more about stocks, but may have all of the knowledge necessary to jump straight into trading sites, such as Robinhood. Services available on our website include viewing stock information, viewing tickers for some of the biggest companies in order to effectively view the information, viewing the gainers and losers on a paritcular day and viewing historical data (up to one year ago) and moving average plots for companies. 

This project utilizes the following technologies: 
- Django
- Python3
